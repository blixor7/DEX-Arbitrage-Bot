# DEX Arbitrage Bot

A high-performance MEV arbitrage bot built using Rust and Solidity. This project provides insight into the fundamentals of DEX arbitrage and serves as a foundation for those interested in exploring MEV strategies in blockchain environments.

---

## Overview

This repository is intended as an educational resource for understanding how arbitrage opportunities are identified and executed on decentralized exchanges.
Some advanced optimizations and private strategies have been removed for clarity, making the bot suitable for learning and experimentation.

While simplified, the bot can perform profitable trades on smaller EVM-compatible networks with low competition. It is **not intended** for high-frequency environments such as Ethereum Mainnet or Binance Smart Chain, where competition among bots is extremely high.

## Disclaimer

Use this software entirely at your own risk.
It is not guaranteed to generate profits and may result in financial loss.
The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate the mechanics of MEV arbitrage in a controlled and educational context, not to serve as a production-grade trading system.

## Purpose of Open Source

Entering the field of MEV can be challenging due to limited public information and high technical barriers.
By making this project open-source, the goal is to:

* Provide a clear, understandable example of DEX arbitrage logic
* Encourage new developers to learn how MEV operates in decentralized ecosystems
* Support further research and innovation in fair and transparent blockchain trading

---

## Features

* Queries Uniswap V2 pairs
* Finds matching trading pairs across multiple exchanges
* Updates and monitors token pair reserves
* Identifies profitable arbitrage paths
* Executes simulated arbitrage transactions

Currently, the code sends a fixed test amount (1 ETH) when a profitable route is found. An improved version could include an optimized function for determining the best trade size.

---

## Examples

The **examples** directory includes several practical utilities and test functions, such as:

* Viewing pending transactions in the mempool
* Tracking pending Uniswap V2 swaps
* Subscribing to new blocks

Any of these can be executed using:

```bash
cargo run --example <example_name>
```

---

## Suggested Improvements

Developers interested in contributing could focus on:

* Creating a more accurate profit optimization function
* Expanding token search to evaluate multiple opportunities simultaneously
* Reducing gas consumption in the execution logic

Pull requests for bug fixes, optimizations, and new ideas are always welcome.
